# zic

Zip files In Concert. This is a package manager that aims to be:

* Dead simple
* An "RPM" or "DEB" for project-level, source-code repositories
* That is based almost completely on plain old zip files


Being that this isn't a "YUM" or "APT" for source code repos, it is
best paired with [Degasolv](https://github.com/djhaskin987/degasolv).
